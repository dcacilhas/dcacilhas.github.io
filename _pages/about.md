My name is David Cacilhas. I'm a software developer from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. I am currently a student at Mohawk College in the Software Development program and will be graduating in December 2015.

Blog topics will include programming/software development, video games, movies, TV shows, fitness, soccer, and anything else that piques my interest.
