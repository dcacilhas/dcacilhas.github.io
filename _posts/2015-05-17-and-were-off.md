excerpt: Thoughts on my first foray into blogging/website creation.
---

My first foray into blogging/website creation is up and running. I took the opportunity to explore some new technologies that I was interested in.

I am using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to create a virtual machine for local [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) development. Combined with [Git](http://git-scm.com/) this allows me to maintain the same development environment on both my desktop and laptop. I followed this guide for [Running Jekyll in Windows](http://www.jamessturtevant.com/posts/running-jekyll-in-windows/) to get Vagrant set up.

The site is hosted using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). Can't beat free!

The [Hyde theme](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) is used for the layout, with a few minor modifications of my own.

[Sublime Text 2](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is my editor of choice. I installed the [MarkdownEditing](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MarkdownEditing) and [Jekyll](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jekyll) plugins to help with the workflow.
